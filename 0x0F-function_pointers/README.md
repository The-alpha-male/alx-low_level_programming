0-print_name.c Write a function that prints a name

1-array_iterator.c - function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

Prototype: void array_iterator(int *array, size_t size, void (*action)(int));
where size is the size of the array
and action is a pointer to the function you need to use

2-int_index.c - function that searches for an integer.

Prototype: int int_index(int *array, int size, int (*cmp)(int));
where size is the number of elements in the array array
cmp is a pointer to the function to be used to compare values
int_index returns the index of the first element for which the cmp function does not return 0
If no element matches, return -1
If size <= 0, return -1

3-main.c - program prints the result of the operation, followed by a new line

3-op_functions.c - This file contains the 5 following functions (not more):

op_add: returns the sum of a and b. Prototype: int op_add(int a, int b);
op_sub: returns the difference of a and b. Prototype: int op_sub(int a, int b);
op_mul: returns the product of a and b. Prototype: int op_mul(int a, int b);
op_div: retur
ns the result of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_div(int a, int b);
op_mod: returns the remainder of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_mod(int a, int b);

3-get_op_func.c- file should contain the function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user. Youâ€™re not allowed to declare any other function.


3-calc.h - This file should contain your main function only.

You are not allowed to code any other function than main in this file
You are not allowed to directly call op_add, op_sub, op_mul, op_div or op_mod from the main function
You have to use atoi to convert arguments to int
You are not allowed to use any kind of loop
You are allowed to use a maximum of 3 if statements

100-main_opcodes.c - nprogram that prints the opcodes of its own main function
